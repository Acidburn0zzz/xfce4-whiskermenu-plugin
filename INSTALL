Basic Installation
==================

CMake is designed for the build process to be done in a separate
directory. The simplest way to compile this plugin is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the source code.

  2. `mkdir build && cd build' to create a location for building.

  3. `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..' to configure the sources.
     There are more options you can pass to cmake, see below for details.

  4. `make' to compile the plugin. This will also rerun cmake for you if
     any CMakeLists.txt files have changed.

  5. `make install' to install the plugin. This has to be done with root
     privileges if installing to system directories, but the rest of the
     build should be done with regular user privileges.

You can instead install the plugin into a temporary directory:

  6. `make install DESTDIR=/tmp' to install the plugin into /tmp but
     with paths referencing $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

Debug Builds
============

You should create different directories for each type of build:

  1. `mkdir debug && cd debug' to create a location for building.

  2. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debugfull ..' to configure the sources.

  3. `make' to compile the plugin.
